# Black-Hole-Baller
This project is made in unity. This is an "Anti-Physics" game made for a Game Jam Competition which won the FIRST PRIZE for the POC. The concept of the game involves trying to put the ball in the Black Hole. There is space constraint, time constraint and anti gravity which makes this game much more exciting and most importantly "Anti Physics"."
